# TE_vending_machine_capstone
Tech Elevator Vending Machine Capstone Project.


This Project was my first chance at writing code from scratch. We had several difficulties writing this code but overall I am proud of how my first project turned out. We used OOP for the first time on our own in this project. As someone who didn't know how to write a variable not to long before this and knowing there is room for a LOT of improvements, this project did exactly what was intended with it and that was to further learn OOP and reinforce what we learned up to that point.
